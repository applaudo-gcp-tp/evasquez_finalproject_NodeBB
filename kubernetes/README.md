# NodeBB
NodeBB Forum Software is powered by Node.js and supports either Redis, MongoDB, or a PostgreSQL database. It utilizes web sockets for instant interactions and real-time notifications. NodeBB takes the best of the modern web: real-time streaming discussions, mobile responsiveness, and rich RESTful read/write APIs, while staying true to the original bulletin board/forum format â†’ categorical hierarchies, local user accounts, and asynchronous messaging.

For the installation of this application, you require:
- **NoSQL database**

# Pipelines in Github actions
To support the automation of the docker image creation, it has been implemented Github Actions on this repo that allows to test, build and push the image to GCR.

Processs goes as explained next:
- Developer creates code in a new branch
- On pull request to develop  or master branch, triggers actions, a test Pipeline.
- The code is approved, and is time to create a tag to mark this point of the functional code.
- Tag Created and pushed to repo, triggers a docker pipeline.
- **Docker Pipeline** builds a new docker image and pushes it to a Google container registry.

# NodeBB in Kubernetes

In this repo, in Kubernetes folder are the Kubernetes manifests to deploy the application in a Kubernetes environment. 

- **Deployment manifest**, nodebb-deployment.yaml in this file its defined the containers for the appllication to work, the image that the container uses, and also volume mounts for the container.
- ***NodeBB*** container, uses a docker image built by this application pipeline and uploaded to GCR.
- **Claim manifest**, claim persistent volumes to save data of the application. It saves the build of the app, and some other configurations generated by the app.
- **Service Manifest**, to expose the application on the cluster.
- **Ingress Manifest**, Creates a nginx ingress object to allow users to connect through a domain name to the NodeBB App.

## Application Diagram

The next diagram shows how the application works, the deployment creates the pod with a container, nodebb container connects to the Redis Database through a VPC Network Peering created on the network, The Redis database is created in a google managed service Memorystore.
Then the NodeBB app its exposed via service and allows connections and visibility from outside through a nginx ingress object, connecting to the load balancer.
